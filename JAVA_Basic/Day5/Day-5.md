# Day 5: Pattern Printing Programs

This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate various pattern printing techniques using nested loops. These programs are part of the Java basics learning series, focusing on control structures and output formatting.

## Programs Overview

### 1. A0_1Triangle.java
Prints a right-angled triangle pattern with alternating 0s and 1s.

### 2. Floyds_Triangle.java
Implements Floyd's Triangle, printing consecutive numbers in a triangular pattern.

### 3. hollowrectangle.java
Creates a hollow rectangle pattern using asterisks (*).

### 4. invertedRightangletriangle.java
Prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern with asterisks.

### 5. InvertedRightangletrianglewithnumber.java
Prints an inverted right-angled triangle with numbers.

### 6. mirrorRightangleTriangle.java
Creates a mirrored right-angled triangle pattern.

### 7. rightangletriangle.java
Prints a basic right-angled triangle using asterisks.

### 8. Rightangletrianglewithnumber.java
Prints a right-angled triangle with numbers.

### 9. solidRectangle.java
Creates a solid rectangle filled with asterisks.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this directory: `cd JAVA_Basic/Day5`
3. Compile the Java file: `javac <filename>.java`
4. Run the program: `java <classname>`

Example:
```
javac rightangletriangle.java
java rightangletriangle
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding nested loops
- Pattern recognition and implementation
- Basic output formatting in Java
- Loop control and iteration

## Notes

- All programs use a fixed number of rows (typically 4-5) for demonstration
- Programs can be modified to accept user input for dynamic row counts
- These patterns form the foundation for more complex graphical outputs
